# Deep Learning-Based Acceleration of OCT From Acquisition to High-Fidelity Reconstruction
This is the code for the transformation from A-scan to B-scan.\
In the folder OCT_Tools, there are files needed for raw OCT signal extraction, mean A Scan computation and B-Scan Generation using the SciPy method in ConvertFolder2TIFF.py.\
In the folder code, you can find all the code needed for the training and evaluation of the U-Net and Pix2Pix.\
Pre-trained models and dataset are loaded in my personal Google Drive, since both the notebooks have been executed on Google Collab using the GPU Nvidia A100
